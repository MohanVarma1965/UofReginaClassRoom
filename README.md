# UofReginaClassRoom
UoRClassRoom is a noble assessment web application, which helps to increase studentâ€™s engagement in the classroom 
and track their performance with good interactive interfaces and analytics that can be used by lecturer to assess 
the student. In this project lecturer can create a class room and post his questions of his choice. Now student can 
join with the class room number created by lecturer and answer the questions. After the student answers the questions, 
lecturer can join into the room to see the results in column chats. I have used React for the front end view part and 
Redux to manage the application state. Redux communicates with Googles Firebase for authentication and also its NoSQL 
data base to manage the state of application. For deployment and hosting I have used the Firebase Hosting.
